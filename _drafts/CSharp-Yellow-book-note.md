Information about information is called metadata. The word meta in this situation implies a "stepping back" from the problem to allow it to be considered in a broader context. In the case of our window program the metadata will tell us more about the values that are being used and produced, specifically the units in which the information is expressed and the valid range of values that the information may have. For any quantity that you represent in a program that you write you must have at least this level of metadata.
