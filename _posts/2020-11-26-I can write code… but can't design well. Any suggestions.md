S.Robins:  
The only way to become really good at something is to try, fail spectacularly, try again, fail again a little less than before, and over time develop the experience to recognize what causes your failures so that you can manage potential failure situations later on. This is as true of learning to play a musical instrument, drive a car, or earn some serious PWN-age in your favourite first person shooter, as it is of learning any aspect of software development.

There are no real shortcuts, but there are things you can do to avoid having problems get out of hand while you are gaining experience.

* Identify a good mentor. There is nothing better than being able to talk about your issues with someone who has already paid their dues. Guidance is a great way to help fast-track learning.
* Read, read some more, practice what you've been reading, and repeat for the entire lifetime of your career. I've been doing this stuff for more than 20 years, and I still get a kick out learning something new every day. Learn not just about up front design, but also emergent design, testing, best practices, processes and methodologies. All have varying degrees of impact on how your designs will emerge, take shape, and more importantly, how they last over time.
* Find time to tinker. Either get involved with a skunkwork project through your workplace, or practice on your own time. This goes hand-in-hand with your reading, by putting your new knowledge into practice, and seeing how such things will work. This is also the stuff that makes for a good discussion with your mentor.
* Get involved with something technical outside of your workplace. This could be a project, or a forum. Something that will allow you to test out your theories and ideas outside of your immediate circle of peers in order to maintain a fresh perspective on things.
* Be patient. Recognize that earning experience takes time, and learn to accept that you need to back off for a while in order to learn why and where you have failed.
* Keep a diary or a blog of your tasks, your thoughts, your failures and your successes. This isn't strictly necessary, however I have found that it can be of great benefit to you to see how you have developed over time, how your skills have grown and your thoughts have changed. I come back to my own journals every few months and look at the stuff I wrote 4-5 years ago. It's a real eye-opener discovering just how much I'd learned in that time. It's also a reminder that I got things wrong from time to time. It's a healthy reminder that helps me improve.

vski:  
+1 great answer, but I find that it's somewhat incomplete. I believe that the most important contribution by far would be to have a very good appetite for **refactoring**. Write, look at what the theory says (articles, books or mentor), refactor/rewrite, go back to theory, refactor/rewrite - this will give you time to focus on structure, while working with familiar code. Be your own worst critic. I would also say that it's very important that you never ever ever lose this appetite for constantly revisiting your own work

kevin cline:  
Stop designing and learn to refactor code.
